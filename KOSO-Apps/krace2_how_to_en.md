**This app is designed for track use. Please do not use it on public roads and ensure safety precautions are followed during use.**

K Race is a data monitoring tool designed to assist vehicle drivers in performance adjustments. By connecting to the Powertry hardware device via Bluetooth, it efficiently monitors driving data. The Powertry device is equipped with a high-performance GPS and gyroscope module, enabling data recording at very high frequencies. This ensures highly accurate and effective data, making it far superior to apps that rely solely on mobile GPS data.

For performance testing, you can select speed or distance tests, such as 0-100 km/h acceleration or 400-meter distance tests. These tests provide detailed insights into the vehicle's performance and data, which are presented in segmented and curve charts. This makes it convenient for drivers to compare data, apply it to performance tuning, and observe results. K Race is an excellent tool for optimizing performance tuning.
